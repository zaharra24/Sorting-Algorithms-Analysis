# Sorting Algorithm Performance Analysis
Java program benchmarking the performance of six classic sorting algorithms with runtime analysis.

## Overview
A Java program that implements and benchmarks **six classic sorting algorithms**:
- Insertion Sort  
- Selection Sort  
- Bubble Sort  
- Shell Sort  
- Quick Sort  
- Merge Sort  

The program compares algorithm efficiency by running them on randomized integer lists of varying sizes and measuring runtime performance. Results are displayed in a formatted table, highlighting differences between **O(nÂ²)** and **O(n log n)** algorithms.  

## Features
- Custom implementations of six sorting algorithms in Java  
- Benchmarking framework for multiple trials and input sizes  
- Automatic tabular output for best, average, and worst-case runtimes  

## Technologies
- Java  
- Random number generation for test datasets  
- `System.nanoTime()` for timing  

## How to Run
